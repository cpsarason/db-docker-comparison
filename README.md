# db-docker-comparison

this is a project for managing various docker images
useful for doing data science/analytics work.

General plan is to create images for:

1. MongoDB
1. Postgres
1. InfluxDB

These images can then be used as part of a tutorial looking
at performance of the different databases (and, ideally,
ease installation/use of these in AWS, Azure and/or GCP.)

Practice makes perfect?
