this is a directory for hosting various docker images
useful for doing data science/analytics work. 

General plan is to create images for:

1) MongoDB
2) Postgres
3) InfluxDB

These images can then be used as part of a tutorial looking
at performance of the different databases (and, ideally, 
ease installation/use of these in AWS, Azure and/or GCP.)

Practice makes perfect?
